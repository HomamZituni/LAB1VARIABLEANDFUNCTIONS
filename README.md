Reflection for Lab 1
1.	How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
I completed the assignment by using what we did in class. I focused on using functions that handled different inputs rather than hardcoded values. formatFullname(firstName, lastName) accepts user input and formats it dynamically.
Similarly for the numeric calculations that can handle a combination of numbers to make both functions reusable.
3.	What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
The biggest challenge was probably the checkEligibility function and ensuring that the logic could correctly evaluate the conditions.
Ensuring that the formatFullName function returned an error when inputs were missing. 
5.	How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
Refactoring allowed the code to be easier to read because instead of filling the code with many new functions, you could simply write one function that handles multiple cases, making it easier to read.
Clear variables and good formatting are also required for readability. Maintainability is writing the least and simplest code possible, so it does not confuse future people.
